I am a PhD student currently specializing in Algorithmic Monitoring of the World Wide Web. I have had the opportunity to work internationally in research, government, and business environments. Specialized in in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Web Scraping, I have a keen interest in applying these digital skills to current societal challenges.

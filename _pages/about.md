PhD student currently specializing into Artificial Intelligence and Monitoring of the World Wide Web. I've had the opportunity to work and study internationally, giving me experience in both research, government, and business environments. Highly proficient in Python and R, I've gained a lot of experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Analysis, as well as a keen interest to apply these methods to current issues and problems.
